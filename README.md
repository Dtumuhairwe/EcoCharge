# EcoCharge ‚Äì EV Charging Optimization System  

EcoCharge is a **concept data system** designed during my Data Engineering coursework to show how an electric vehicle (EV) charging network could use data to improve energy management and sustainability.  

This project demonstrates how I plan, organize, and simulate a working data pipeline ‚Äî from data ingestion to visualization ‚Äî using tools and techniques I‚Äôve learned as a Data Science graduate student at the **University of the Pacific (Stockton, CA)**.

## Project Overview  
- Simulates how an EV charging company could collect and analyze usage data  
- Demonstrates data pipeline design and analysis workflow using **Python** and **SQL**  
- Focuses on data organization, transformation, and dashboard planning

## System Design
```
[ EV Chargers / Simulated Data ]
          ‚Üì
     Data Ingestion
   (Python / CSV files)
          ‚Üì
     Processing & Cleaning
   (Pandas concepts)
          ‚Üì
     Analysis & Queries
   (SQL concepts)
          ‚Üì
     Visualization
   (Power BI / Tableau mockups)
```
The system is designed conceptually and can be extended to real datasets later.

## Tools and Technologies  
**Programming:** Python, SQL  
**Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn (concept)  
**Big Data (concepts):** Apache Spark, Hadoop  
**Visualization:** Power BI, Tableau  
**Cloud (concepts):** Google Cloud, Azure  

---

## Results (Concept Demonstration)  
Planned dashboards (Power BI/Tableau):  
- Energy use by hour/location  
- Forecasted vs. actual demand (regression)  
- Station efficiency & sustainability trends  

---

## Future Expansion  
- Add open EV datasets for testing  
- Try Spark Streaming or scheduled batch updates  
- Host dashboards in the cloud (BigQuery / Looker)  
- Interactive filters (by station, day, season)  

---

## What I Learned  
- Architecting an end-to-end data flow  
- Cleaning/transforming data for analysis  
- How Spark/cloud tools fit modern analytics  
- Communicating insights with dashboards
