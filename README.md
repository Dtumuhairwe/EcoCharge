# EcoCharge – EV Charging Optimization System  

EcoCharge is a **concept data system** designed during my Data Engineering coursework to show how an electric vehicle (EV) charging network could use data to improve energy management and sustainability.  

This project demonstrates how I plan, organize, and simulate a working data pipeline — from data ingestion to visualization — using tools and techniques I’ve learned as a Data Science graduate student at the **University of the Pacific (Stockton, CA)**.

## Project Overview  
- Simulates how an EV charging company could collect and analyze usage data  
- Demonstrates data pipeline design and analysis workflow using **Python** and **SQL**  
- Focuses on data organization, transformation, and dashboard planning
